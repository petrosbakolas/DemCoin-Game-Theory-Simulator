# DemCoin Game Theory Simulator 🎯

## Τι είναι αυτό; / What is this?

A simulation tool for modeling how citizens will behave in the DemCoin economy. Uses game theory to predict:
- Participation rates
- Quality of contributions
- Nash equilibria under different parameter settings
- Optimal reward structures

## Γιατί το χρειαζόμαστε; / Why we need this?

Before launching DemCoin in real municipalities, we need to predict:
- Will citizens actually participate?
- What reward levels will drive quality engagement?
- How do we prevent gaming the system?
- What's the optimal balance between incentives and costs?

## Πώς δουλεύει; / How it works?

### The Basic Model

Citizens face a choice:
- **Study** the policy proposal (costs time, earns DemCoins)
- **Ignore** it (saves time, earns nothing)

The simulator calculates:
1. **Individual payoffs** for each strategy
2. **Nash equilibrium** - what will everyone do?
3. **Predicted participation rate**
4. **Expected policy quality**

### Parameters We Can Adjust

- `demcoin_per_hour`: How many DemCoins per hour of quality work
- `success_bonus`: Extra DemCoins if policy succeeds
- `quality_threshold`: Minimum quality score to earn rewards
- `time_cost`: Hours needed to meaningfully engage

### What We Predict

- Participation rate (% of citizens engaging)
- Average quality score
- System sustainability (costs vs. SVI improvement)
- Optimal parameter settings
